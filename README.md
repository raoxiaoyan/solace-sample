# Solace JavaScript API Examples

<!-- Content from docs/README.md should be included here -->

## Quick Start

This project uses pnpm as the package manager and provides a simple HTTP server to run the examples.

### Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (recommended version 14.x or higher)
- Install pnpm: `npm install -g pnpm`

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Start the Project

```bash
pnpm start
```

This will start a local HTTP server and open the homepage in your browser, where you can access all the examples.

### Development Mode

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Same as the `start` command, but automatically refreshes the browser when files change.

## Browsing Examples

After starting the project, you can view all available examples on the homepage and access individual examples by clicking on their respective links. Each example provides a demonstration of a specific messaging pattern.
